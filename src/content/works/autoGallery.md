A mobile application to **auto delete** images.You can **take images** from any camera app and **save them** within the app. You can also specify a **duration limit** for expiry. When this expiry time is reached, corresponding images will be **deleted automatically.**

I developed this application to play with <a href="https://docs.hivedb.dev/#/" target="_blank">Hive DB</a> which is similar to a Mongo DB system for local persistant storage in flutter

This project was developed on request of my friend who runs a Vehicle Emission Checking agency. He takes images quite frequently for vehicle check. This project had the shortest development time among all my projects. This took me just a few days to develop and release in the playstore

Unfortunately my google developer account got suspended and all my apps are now lost. But you can still take a look at the code in github.
