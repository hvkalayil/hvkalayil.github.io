Learn.io is a full-stack web platform for sharing and exploring community-driven courses built with MDX. Developed using a **Deno monorepo** with Fresh (frontend) and Deno APIs (backend), it allows users to view courses, track progress, and manage wishlists.

The platform features a **peer-review-based** promotion system where learners become teachers after reviewing five courses, enabling them to submit and publish new content. While core concepts are implemented, several features are still under development as part of an ongoing personal project.
