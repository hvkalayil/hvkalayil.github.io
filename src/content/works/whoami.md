A android application that can store your personal data **like a business card.** You can add **social media** links and personal **files**. You can choose to upload it in the cloud. Security of files are ensured with **AES encryption.**

This was my first project that I worked on in flutter. I was reluctant to publish it even after completing it. But I got to it after publishing waverix

Unfortunately my google developer account got suspended and all my apps are now lost. But you can still take a look at the code in github.
