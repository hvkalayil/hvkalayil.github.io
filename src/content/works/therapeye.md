A mobile application that helps to**save and share medical records** among patients anddoctors. User can opt to keep records **locally**or **in the server.**

I worked on this project during my internship at <a href="https://sauda.co/" target="_blank">Saudha Technologies.</a> This was my first time building **both front end and back end** of a system.

Thanks to my mentor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhav-bahadur-80b93472/" target="_blank">Vaibhav Bahadhur</a> I was able to learn a lot and successfully deliver system as per client requirements
