A website for Combustion Research Lab of IIT Bombay. Its a website for the staff to **view and share the publications** and also as a website for the lab.

This is a simple **content management system with admin** sign in. It also **crawls the Google Scholar search results** and adds publications of the team automatically.

This was my first time experimenting with python frameworks. <a href="assets/cert/python.pdf" target="_blank">**These courses**</a> inspired me to crawl google scholar since I could not find any API for it and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA" target="_blank">**this video**</a> from freecodecamp helped me to kick start the project. I was intrigued to start a project and thats when <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=1PlWbsIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">**my eldest brother**</a> asked me to create this website.
