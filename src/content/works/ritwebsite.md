A website developed for my college. This was done as part of my academic project. The website was build to showcase courses in the college and achievements. The system supports multi-user login, localization and follows a resposnive design

I worked alongside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shiby-thomas-7a623b1b5/" target="_blank">Shiby Thomas</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashly-mohan-5b3379134/" target="_blank">Ashly Mohan</a> as a group and delivered system to our keen eyed professors. The professors mentored and helped us deliver the requirements.
