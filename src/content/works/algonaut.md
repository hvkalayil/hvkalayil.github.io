Algonaut is a web application that serves as a tool for users seeking to deepen their understanding of algorithms while effectively monitoring their learning progress and celebrating their achievements once logged in. The front end of Algonaut was crafted using **Angular** , ensuring a seamless and intuitive user interface. I orchestrated the deployment on GitHub Pages, employing a streamlined build and deploy process managed through a **Github Action.**

On the backend, I architected robust APIs utilizing **NestJS** , a modern and scalable framework. It also integrates well with **Swagger** as well, so I have documented the API endpoints in the application The entire backend infrastructure was deployed using **Render.**

Algonaut represents a labor of love, reflecting my genuine dedication to crafting meaningful web applications. It aims to offer a helpful tool for individuals keen on delving into the world of algorithms.
